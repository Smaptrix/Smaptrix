Route Description:

JB Morrell Library- Start your day by grabbing a hot drink of choice at the University’s JB Morrell library café.  Find somewhere to sit in the library based on your personal preference of study space. Fairhurst library has more group working spaces and is generally louder, while Burton is a dedicated silent area, and Morrell allows low talking.

Cecil’s Pizzeria- From the west campus library, either catch a bus or walk over to Campus east and grab a quick lunch from Cecil’s Pizza and Grill.  They have online ordering options if you want to save time.

Piazza building- From East campus, head into the piazza building and find a seat- either in the designated Library@ Piazza room or one of the many sofa seats scattered around the building.  There’s also a Starbucks in the building if you need a caffeine boost.

Ron Cooke Hub - The Piazza Building closes at 10, but if you fancy a late night study session, you can head directly over to the 24/7 Ron Cooke Hub, which has open study spaces and computers scattered across three levels, as well as some bookable study rooms for individual or group sessions.
