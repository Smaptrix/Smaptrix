The front of the Popworld nightclub. Black double doors are surrounded by a thick purple frame. The wall of the building is painted white. The sign above the door frame reads popworld with the first 'p' in blue, the first 'o' in yellow, second 'p' is pink, and the rest of the text is white on a black background. A large window is above the sign. Posters are on either side of the door displaying details about an upcoming event. Metal railings are in-front of the door on the side of the road.
