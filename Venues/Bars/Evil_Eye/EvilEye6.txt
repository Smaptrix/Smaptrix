The photograph shows a section of Evil Eye where the seating is on the floor.
There are 2 cream pillows either side of the table, and 4 pillows on the back wall.
The back wall is a dark wood. Infront of the table is a detailed archway also made out of wood.
The carpet below the table is in a diamond pattern.
