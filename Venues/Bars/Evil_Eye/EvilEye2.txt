The photo displays an interior shot of Evil Eyes bar. It is busy with people.
The bar is on the left, and there are customers on the right.
PRojected on the roof is a galaxy pattern that is a deep shade of purple with green specks in it.
The walls are green and are scattered with photos and menus.
The lights hanging from the cieling also accomodate greenery on top of them.
