Description: 
At Brew & Brownie we believe in and are inspired by seasonal, local where possible, quality ingredients.
We have spent many hours researching and discovering some of Yorkshire’s best produce, such as Raydale Preservesbased in the sleepy village of Stalling Busk, Johnson’s free range eggs, Bishy Road’s M & K butchers, not to mention Haxby Bakehouse’s amazing bread! We care where our food is sourced from and always look for the best quality produce to serve our customers.
We also serve real loose leaf tea from Brew Tea Co.
We include vegan & gluten free options both savoury & sweet as much as we can, one of our lovely staff will be happy to chat about the options available that day.
