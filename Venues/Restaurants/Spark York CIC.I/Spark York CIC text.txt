Description:
SPARK* is a project centred around positive social change. Our aim was to transform Piccadilly, a rundown and underutilised street in the centre of York and turn it into a vibrant, colourful destination that York could be proud of. We want local people to benefit from regeneration.
We have a complementary mix of entrepreneurs from different sectors, with the curation of retail, food and drink, workspace and arts and culture. This encourages collaboration, knowledge and business skills to create ambitious yet resilient start-ups and innovative companies that can change York - now and in the future.
