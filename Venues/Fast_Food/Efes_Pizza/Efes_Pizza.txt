Description:
When it comes to Efes Pizza Takeaway we had 2 main goals in mind, the first was to be able to provide our clients with quality meals at any time of the day. We wanted them to know that on any given day they could leave the cooking to us, and the eating to them. A fact that we accomplished by focusing on the takeaway aspect of our experience. As for the second goal, that was to bring back a lot of traditional flavors of pizza that arenâ€™t commonly seen in most restaurants. While it's true that pizza became so popular in large part due to it's ease of making, it still has a long history and tradition behind it, and our menu brings that tradition right back to the 21st century.
